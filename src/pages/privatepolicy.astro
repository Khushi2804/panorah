          <h3>NOTICE</h3>
          <p>
            We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies
            you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally,
            this information is requested when you create a Registration ID on
            the site or when you download free software, enter a contest, order
            e-mail newsletters or join a limited-access premium site. We use
            your Personal Information for four primary purposes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter
              information more than once.
            </li>
            <li>To help you quickly find software, services or information.</li>

          <h3>SECURITY</h3>
          <p>
            PANORAH has taken strong measures to protect the security of your
            personal information and to ensure that your choices for its
            intended use are honored. We take strong precautions to protect your
            data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure,
            alteration, or destruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            We guarantee your e-commerce transactions to be 100% safe and
            secure. When you place orders or access your personal account
            information, you're utilizing a secure server software SSL, which
            encrypts your personal information before it's sent over the
            Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies
            available.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, your transactions are guaranteed under the Fair Credit
            Billing Act. This Act states that your bank cannot hold you liable
            for more than $50.00 in fraudulent credit card charges. If your bank
            does hold you liable for $50.00 or less, we'll cover your liability
            provided the unauthorized, fraudulent use of your credit card
            resulted through no fault of your own and from purchases made from
            us over our secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your
            credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance
            with its reporting rules and procedures.

          <h3>ELECTRONIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION</h3>

          <p>
            When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register
            your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your
            registration information with any information you've already left
            with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you
            haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal profile
            for you from your product registration information. If you ever want
            to review or update that information, you can visit the Profile
            Center, click on Update Profile, and edit any of the Personal
            Information in your profile. If you haven't already created a
            Registration ID, we will ask you to do so. This ensures that only
            you can access your information.
          </p>

          <h3>CUSTOMER PROFILES</h3>
          <p>
            As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal
            profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification
            number, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.
          </p>
          <p>When you register, we create your profile, which includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Information you have already provided us such as your name,
              address, phone number, and email address.
            </li>
            <li>
              Information you have updated, such as your preferences for
              receiving marketing information.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We use this information to help you more easily purchase products,
            download free software, and register your products. You can view and
            modify your personal profile by visiting the Profile Center.
